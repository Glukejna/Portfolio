# Research into the promising direction of video games

## Description

The objective of the project is to develop the basic principles of working with data that will allow predicting the most profitable areas of video games for an online store.
From open sources available to us are available historical data (until 2016) on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation).

During the study, I identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
