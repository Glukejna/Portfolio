# Portfolio

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex Practicum.

Yandex Practicum online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.

The company develops and promotes entertainment applications for various types of devices. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been losing money for the past few months.
